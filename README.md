# Rolls Royce

Rolls Royce is a minimal and responsive [Ghost](http://ghost.org) theme focusing on your content. With smooth and slick javascripts transitions, the experience is elegant and simple - just like the Ghost blogging platform.

Expect updates - this theme is maturing along with Ghost. Feel free to [add suggested features](https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce/issues?state=open).

## How to install

1. Navigate to your Ghost theme directory ghost/content/themes

2. Clone theme repo using below command ```git clone https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce "rollsroyce"```

3. Restart ghost and log into your dashboard

4. On settings page, select rollsroyce as theme and save.

5. To make custom changes, go to ```default.hbs``` and search for 'TODOs' to add things like twitter handle, google analytics ID, etc. This is a temporary fix to a problem in Ghost v0.4. 

*Note:* Ping me (royce dot haynes at gmail dot.com) if you have any issues.
